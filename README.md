# easy-code-header-ahk
Really simple application to automatically add commented headers in any programming language. 

## Features
- Consistent length of headers
```
#==========================================Python==========================================
#=====================================Random As Title======================================
#======================================Fish Fish Fish======================================
```
- Any programming language is supported (with comments that require only a starting character(s))
```
#==========================================Python==========================================
//============================================C=============================================
<anything>=========================================Anything=========================================
```
- Easy keyboard shortcut!  

## Requirements
Windows OS or anything that could run AHK or .exe files. 

## Usage
Enter the comment character(s) into the text box and click _Okay_. 
_Alt + C_ to convert a line into a header. 

## Future Development
These are changes that may be added in the future:
- Option to customize the filling character (instead of just "====")
- Customizeable length of the header

### Author's Note
Yes I know you can manually copy and paste the "=====" but why? (Why spend 10 mins doing a task when you can spend an hour trying to automate it?)
